### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Include a link back to the homepage from every other page
- Allow users to either edit posts or creat subsequent new posts

#### PostMVP  

- Include feature to allow user to upload thier own photo
- Implement toggle on rerender after new entries are submited
- Include a delete feature for user to delete entries
- Utilize a component library for styling or functionality purposes

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I'm confident in my ablitity to get basic funtionality and styling done and my understading of the how and why of it.

### Weaknesses:
I get flustered when hitting a road block specifically when I'm tryng something that worked once before but then now doesn't. I sometimes shy away from trying something I don't know how to do.

### Opportunities:
I have the opportunity here to take my time and research methods for accomplishing my goals beforehand and to know if I think its a reasonable expectation to achieve and/or give me more time to work with it and learn how to implement it.

### Threats:
My self doubt and tendency to assume I don't know is my biggest threat.
