## Project Description
GrowMe is a note taking app for gardeners. It will allow a user to enter in information about the individual plants they have and also make notes on that particular plant so they can keep track of them as the season progresses and refer back to their notes at later dates.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- link to a form page for user input
- Render entries on page as a list
- Render detail pages for each user entry to include more data
- Include a link back to the homepage from every other page

#### PostMVP  
-Include feature to allow user to upload thier own photo and render on page
-Allow users to either edit posts or creat subsequent new posts
- Implement toggle on rerender after new entries are submited back to display list page
- Include a delete feature for user to delete entries
- Utilize a component library for styling or functionality purposes

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I'm confident in my ablitity to get basic funtionality and styling done and my understading of the how and why of it.

### Weaknesses:
I get flustered when hitting a road block specifically when I'm tryng something that worked once before but then now doesn't. I sometimes shy away from trying something I don't know how to do.

### Opportunities:
I have the opportunity here to take my time and research methods for accomplishing my goals beforehand and to know if I think its a reasonable expectation to achieve and/or give me more time to work with it and learn how to implement it.

### Threats:
My self doubt and tendency to assume I don't know is my biggest threat.
